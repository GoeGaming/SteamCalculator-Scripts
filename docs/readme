SteamCalculator Scripts is written in PERL and its task it it to parse 
Valve's Steam store and save all information from their website by
storing them in a MySQL database.

If you are not a developer or planing to create a new project, that 
might want to use the data these scripts provide, this software might be
no use for you.

Otherwise, install PERL und MySQL (do not forget the DBI package), 
import steamclculator-scripts.sql, edit config.ini to your needs and run 
getGames.pl.
